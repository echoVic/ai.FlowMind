# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature adds Server-Sent Events (SSE) communication capability to the existing Mermaid MCP server. SSE will enable real-time streaming of diagram generation, validation, and optimization results to clients, providing better user experience for long-running operations and real-time feedback during diagram processing.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a client application developer, I want to receive real-time updates during diagram processing operations, so that I can provide immediate feedback to users about the progress of their requests.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a client initiates a diagram processing request THEN the system SHALL establish an SSE connection and stream progress updates
2. WHEN diagram validation is in progress THEN the system SHALL send validation status updates via SSE
3. WHEN diagram optimization is running THEN the system SHALL stream optimization progress and intermediate results
4. WHEN an error occurs during processing THEN the system SHALL immediately send error details via SSE

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a web application user, I want to see real-time progress when generating complex diagrams, so that I know the system is working and can estimate completion time.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a diagram generation request is submitted THEN the system SHALL send progress events with percentage completion
2. WHEN template processing occurs THEN the system SHALL stream template selection and application status
3. WHEN format conversion is in progress THEN the system SHALL send conversion stage updates
4. IF processing takes longer than 2 seconds THEN the system SHALL send keep-alive events every 1 second

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to monitor SSE connection health and performance, so that I can ensure reliable real-time communication.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN SSE connections are established THEN the system SHALL track connection count and status
2. WHEN connections are dropped THEN the system SHALL log disconnection events with reasons
3. WHEN memory usage exceeds thresholds THEN the system SHALL automatically close idle connections
4. IF connection errors occur THEN the system SHALL provide detailed error information for debugging

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a client developer, I want to configure SSE connection parameters, so that I can optimize the communication for my specific use case.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN establishing SSE connection THEN the system SHALL support configurable retry intervals
2. WHEN setting up SSE THEN the system SHALL allow custom event types and data formats
3. WHEN configuring timeouts THEN the system SHALL respect client-specified connection timeout values
4. IF heartbeat is enabled THEN the system SHALL send periodic ping events at configurable intervals

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer integrating the MCP server, I want SSE to work alongside existing MCP protocol, so that I can use both communication methods as needed.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN SSE is enabled THEN the system SHALL maintain full compatibility with existing MCP protocol
2. WHEN both protocols are active THEN the system SHALL handle requests independently without interference
3. WHEN switching between protocols THEN the system SHALL preserve session state and context
4. IF SSE is disabled THEN the system SHALL continue to function normally with MCP-only communication
